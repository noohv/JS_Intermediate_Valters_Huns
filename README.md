## Important
Before starting the project, run `npm install`, to install the required dependencies.

In this case, that's just the package for reading user input, but this is a practice done when downloading any new or existing project for development:
    - Read any README.md files and follow their instructions
    - Check the package.json file's "dependencies" to see which packages need to be installed
    - Run `npm install` to install them


After running `npm install`, to start the project just run `npm start`.

Consider the app.js file in the src folder, the main JS file.
You can add additional files and import stuff from them as needed.

Feel free to reach out if there are any ambiguities or uncertainties about the instructions of this final task.


Good luck and have fun :D
